# Twitter Sentiment Analysis
This project is a Python-based Sentiment Analysis tool designed to analyze public opinion on Twitter in real time. It integrates Twitter API for fetching live tweets and uses TextBlob for sentiment analysis. The workflow involves retrieving tweets based on keywords or hashtags, preprocessing them for noise removal, and then classifying them as positive, negative, or neutral depending on sentiment polarity.


🔹 Key Features

1. **Real-Time Tweet Fetching

   * Connects to the Twitter API to gather tweets dynamically.
   * Users can input a keyword or hashtag to filter and collect relevant tweets.

2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

   * Removes unwanted characters, links, hashtags, mentions, and special symbols.
   * Standardizes the text for accurate analysis by eliminating stopwords and formatting issues.

3. Sentiment Analysis using TextBlob

   * Each tweet is analyzed for sentiment polarity.
   * Classified into Positive, Negative, or Neutral categories.
   * Generates an overall sentiment distribution for the dataset.

4. User Interaction

   * Users only need to enter a keyword or hashtag.
   * The tool handles **data fetching, cleaning, processing, and classification automatically.

5. Insights Generation

   * Provides real-time public sentiment insights on trending topics.
   * Can be applied to brand monitoring, political opinion analysis, product feedback, and social media research.

🔹 How It Works

1. User enters a keyword or hashtag (e.g., AI, Elections, Tesla).
2. The system connects to the Twitter API and fetches a batch of tweets containing that keyword.
3. Tweets are cleaned and preprocessed to remove noise.
4. TextBlob analyzes sentiment polarity for each tweet.
5. Tweets are categorized as:

   * Positive 🙂
   * Negative 🙁
   * Neutral 😐
6. Results can be visualized or further analyzed for insights.

🔹 Tech Stack

* Programming Language: Python
* Libraries: TextBlob, Tweepy (for Twitter API), Pandas, Matplotlib/Seaborn (for visualization, if included)
* API: Twitter API
